# Code of Conduct

## About This Project

This project was created for use at my school's snack bar, managed by the student council. While it's a practical tool for our school community, I've open-sourced it to help other schools and student organizations who might benefit from similar systems.

## Our Pledge

I pledge to make participation in this project and community a harassment-free, welcoming, and educational experience for everyone.

## Our Standards

Examples of behavior that contributes to a positive environment for our community include:

- Using welcoming and inclusive language
- Being respectful of differing viewpoints and experiences
- Gracefully accepting constructive criticism
- Focusing on what is best for the community
- Showing empathy towards other community members
- Being patient with newcomers and those learning
- Providing helpful feedback and support
- Respecting the educational nature of this student-led project

Examples of unacceptable behavior include:

- The use of sexualized language or imagery and unwelcome sexual attention or advances
- Trolling, insulting/derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks
- Public or private harassment
- Publishing others' private information without explicit permission
- Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a professional or educational setting

## My Responsibilities

As project maintainer, I am responsible for clarifying the standards of acceptable behavior and will take appropriate and fair corrective action in response to any instances of unacceptable behavior.

I have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that are not aligned with this Code of Conduct, or to ban temporarily or permanently any contributor for behaviors that I deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies both within project spaces and in public spaces when an individual is representing the project or its community. Examples include using an official project email address, posting via an official social media account, or acting as an appointed representative at an online or offline event.

## Enforcement

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be reported by contacting me at hello@ivanbelousov.com. All complaints will be reviewed and investigated promptly and fairly.

## Attribution

This Code of Conduct is adapted from the [Contributor Covenant](https://www.contributor-covenant.org), version 2.0, available at https://www.contributor-covenant.org/version/2/0/code_of_conduct.html

## A Note on Educational Context

As this project originated in an educational setting, I especially encourage:

- Questions and learning from mistakes
- Constructive peer review and collaboration
- Sharing knowledge and helping others understand the codebase
- Respecting that contributors may be students or learning to code

Everyone starts somewhere, and I want this to be a welcoming place to learn and contribute.
